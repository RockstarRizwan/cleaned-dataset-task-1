This project contains a cleaned dataset titled "cleaned dataset.csv", which has been prepared for use in data analysis and machine learning applications. The dataset has undergone preprocessing steps including the removal of null values, duplicate records, and unnecessary columns or rows to ensure it is ready for model training, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and other AI-related tasks. It is formatted as a CSV file, making it easy to load using Python libraries such as pandas. Users can import the dataset into their environment and begin analyzing or building models with minimal additional processing. This dataset may be useful for developing classification, regression, or clustering models, depending on the nature of its features. It is recommended to review the column names and data types to better understand the kind of insights that can be extracted.
